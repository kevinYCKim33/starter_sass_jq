# SASS and JQUERY Starter Pack

Just some starter pack to start coding in SASS and jQuery out of the gate.

## Installation

Clone down locally first.  

Then:

`npm install`

Also have `live-server` installed (preferably globally).

`npm install live-server -g`

## Usage

In one Terminal tab,

`npm run compile:sass`

In second Terminal tab,

`live-server`

Write your HTML code in `index.html`

Write your SASS code in `sass/main.scss`

Write your jQuery code in `js/script.js`

Do not touch your `css/style.css`, as `sass/main.scss` will overwrite it everytime.

Any code changes automatically updates the browser with the live-server activated now.
